## Codebase Patterns
- Godot scene files (.tscn) use GDScript format=3 with uid references
- Export presets configured in export_presets.cfg (separate from project.godot)
- Audio bus layout stored in default_bus_layout.tres with dB volume levels
- Project uses config_version=5 for Godot 4.2+
- Use autoload (singletons) in project.godot for global managers like GameManager, TranslationManager
- Localization files use JSON format in /assets/locales/{locale}.json
- Translation keys use snake_case format for consistency

## [2025-01-23] - US-001
- Created Godot 4.2 project with project.godot configured (config_version=5)
- Set up folder structure: /assets/sounds, /assets/textures, /assets/locales, /scenes, /scripts
- Created Main.tscn scene with Node2D root
- Configured Android 8.0+ (API 26) export preset in export_presets.cfg
- Set Application/config/name to 'PlayTap'
- Set viewport to 540x960 (portrait mode)
- Added GameManager.gd autoload singleton with signals (game_started, game_ended, reward_trigger)
- Created default_bus_layout.tres with Master (0dB), Background (-8dB), SFX (-3dB), Voice (-4dB) buses
- Added project icon.svg and .gitignore for Godot projects

**Files changed:**
- project.godot (new)
- export_presets.cfg (new)
- default_bus_layout.tres (new)
- icon.svg (new)
- scenes/Main.tscn (new)
- scripts/GameManager.gd (new)
- .gitignore (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Godot scene files use `[gd_scene load_steps=X format=3 uid="uid://..."]` header format
- Export presets are separate from project.godot, stored in export_presets.cfg
- Audio buses use dB values: 0dB is full volume, negative values reduce volume
- Android minimum platform version is set via binary_format/minimum_platform_version=26 in export_presets.cfg
- Viewport size is set in project.godot under [display] section with window/size/viewport_width and viewport_height
- Autoload scripts are registered in [autoload] section with "*res://" prefix
- Use .gitignore to exclude .godot/, import/, and build directories

## [2025-01-23] - US-002
- Audio bus architecture was completed as part of US-001
- default_bus_layout.tres includes all required buses: Master (0dB), Background (-8dB), SFX (-3dB), Voice (-4dB)
- No additional implementation needed

**Files changed:**
- None (completed in US-001)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Audio bus layout can be created during initial project setup
- Bus layout is referenced in export_presets.cfg under audio/buses/default_bus_layout

## [2025-01-23] - US-003
- Created TranslationManager.gd autoload singleton with get_text(key) function
- Created /assets/locales/id.json with Indonesian translations
- Created /assets/locales/en.json with English translations
- All localization keys use snake_case format (e.g., game_tap_pop_name, color_red)
- Added TranslationManager to autoloads in project.godot
- Project locale set to 'id' as default in [locale] section
- TranslationManager supports language switching with set_locale() and emits language_changed signal

**Files changed:**
- scripts/TranslationManager.gd (new)
- assets/locales/id.json (new)
- assets/locales/en.json (new)
- project.godot (updated with TranslationManager autoload)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Localization files are JSON format with key-value pairs
- TranslationManager uses FileAccess to load locale files at runtime
- Fallback to key name if translation not found (prevents crashes)
- Use TranslationManager.get_text("key") from anywhere in code to get translated strings
- Add new translations to both locale files to maintain parity
